# Backdraft for Medium

Medium doesn't currently (January 2016) allow you to set the published date on the stories you post, so there's no way to back-fill posts you've written elsewhere. A comment in the issue log suggested that [the API has undocumented functionality to set the published date](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/6#issuecomment-165587696).

I wanted to test this functionality and build a very basic editor so I could create a story in the past, even if I had to edit on Medium to fill in additional details like tags and license.

Unfortunately it seems like the API does not support setting the published date :(

## Demo

There is a [demo of this code](https://medium-backdraft.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. Beware that it _will_ publish directly to Medium and doesn't validate your input.
